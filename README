README for libbsb
=================

Building and installing
-----------------------
  For Unix and Unix-like OSs (including Mac OS X):
      ./configure
      make
      make check
      make install

  "make install" will install the library libbsb.a, its C header file bsb.h
  and the following conversion programs:
    bsb2ppm        ppm2bsb        bsbfix
    bsb2tif        tif2bsb
    bsb2png        bsbzip2pngs
  and BSB viewer bsbview

  For WIN32 native builds you must install MSYS to be able to run the
  configure script.  MSYS can be downloaded gratis from
  http://www.mingw.org/msys.shtml and once installed run the same commands
  as above for Unix OSs.
    Or, to select the MSVC compiler instead of gcc use:
      ./configure CC=cl
    Or, for a cross-compiler built to target i686-x-mingw32msvc use:
      ./configure --host=i686-x-mingw32msvc

  Optional libraries
  ------------------
  You must have libtiff installed to be able to build bsb2tif and tif2bsb.
  For LZW compression support use libtiff 3.7.0 or later.
    libtiff - http://www.libtiff.org/

  For bsb2png you must have libpng installed.
    libpng  - http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html

  For bsbzip2pngs you must have both libpng and libzip installed
    libzip  - http://libzip.org

  For bsbview you must have lib Qt3 development (libqt3-mt). For windows 
  you can use the free Qt3/win version. The QTDIR environment must be set 
  to the root of your Qt3 installation.


Usage
-----
A sample BSB file is included in the release.  The image is based on a hand
drawn map of Australia so it is not intended for navigational purposes :)
    australia4c.kap  - 4 color chart of Australia


  bsb2tif & tif2bsb
  -----------------
  To convert a BSB file to a TIFF file:
      bsb2tif australia4c.kap australia4c.tif
  
  To convert a TIFF file to BSB you need a template file containing all the
  cartographic information appropriate for the image.  The template file is
  merely the ASCII text lines at the start of a BSB file, and for the conversion
  to work it must contain the RA=<width>,<height> data in the "BSB/" token.
  
    In this example I used the original BSB file as the template:
      tif2bsb australia4c.kap edited.tif new.kap
  
    In this example the max number of colors for the BSB colormap is specified:
      tif2bsb -c 4 australia4c.kap edited.tif new.kap


  bsb2ppm & ppm2bsb
  -----------------
  Usage of bsb2ppm and ppm2bsb is similiar to the TIFF utilities.
      bsb2ppm australia4c.kap australia4c.ppm
      ppm2bsb australia4c.kap edited.ppm new.kap

  bsb2png
  -------
  Usage of bsb2png is similar to other utilities.
      bsb2png australia4c.kap australia4c.png
  
  bsbzip2pngs
  -----------
  To extract and convert each chart (KAP) file found in a zip archive to PNG image:
    bsbzip2pngs example.zip
  For each chart file in the zip named foo.kap, a PNG image foo.png is created.
  
  bsbfix
  ------
  The utility bsbfix fixes the index table in a BSB file that has become
  invalid.  A BSB file becomes invalid whenever you edit the cartographic
  information in the ASCII text header at the start of a BSB file using a text
  editor like vi or emacs.
    E.g.
      Edit the BSB file to change registration points in the text header:
        vi australia4c.kap
      Fix the binary index table in the BSB file:
        bsbfix australia4c.kap

  bsbview  [-t] [-v] [-q] [<bsbfile>]
  -------
  This is the BSB chart viewer.
  Use mouse right click for pop menu. 
  The About info shows key shortcuts and mouse use.
  Parameters:
  -t test geotransformation (converts all reference points 
     from chart to lat/lon and back and displays relative errors)
  -v verbose output for -t
  -q quit without displaying the graphics (only with -t)
  <bsbfile> the file to show (when skipped it will ask you to choose one)
            With popup menu you may choose another .KAP file.
